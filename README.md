# software-linguist

The goal of this repository is to provide all CS fundamentals plus software engineering and software architecting concepts in three different languages: Go, Rust and Typescript.

I will be dividing all these concepts, from Data Structures and Algorithms all the way to different web architectures, working with different databases and creating complex applications with different programming paradigms, databases, etc.

All the material is public, I really hope you find some value!

I will also create a methodology to benchmark the three languages, and compare them in the traditional sense (memory, speed, scaling), but I will also compare them in terms of what language had a better developer experience, and why I would choose one over the other in production-grade environments.

In every single subjec you will find a mark-down with all the requirements, and a little design doc with all the engineering decisions I took, mainly focused on:

1. Which frameworks, libraries or packages were used and why
2. Which datasets to use for testing
3. Scope of the app and limitations per language

And every other consideration took to build the projects.

You will also find a ´go´ , ´rust´ and ´typescript´ directory, with a fully working application. Each folder will have it's individual README file with installation guides and how to use, and every project will be unit tested up to 100% coverage.

For every single project I will use the same version of each programming language.

Typescript - 4.37 (TODO: update to latest)
Go - 1.21 (TODO: update to latest I'll use)
Rust - X (TODO: update to latest)

In case you have never used any of these languages, check the Language installation guides [docs/installation.md].
If you want to learn more about each specific languache, chekc the additional resources [docs/additional-resources.md]. Those are divided by Language, and there is a special section for Common Computer Science!
